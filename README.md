# Text-Encryption
A code to encrypt text using Caesar's Cipher. In cryptography, a Caesar Cipher, also known as shift cipher, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter of some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

For example, with a left shift of 3, D is replaced by A; E is replaced by B etc. 

Thus for a Caesar using left shift of 3 (same as right shift of 23),

Plain: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Cipher: XYZBCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW

The plain text statement: THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
becomes
Cipher text: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBQ QEB IXWV ALD.
